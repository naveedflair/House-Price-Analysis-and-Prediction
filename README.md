# Project Overview 
This project involves analyzing and modeling a real estate dataset to predict property prices. 
Various data preprocessing techniques, feature selection, and machine learning algorithms are 
applied to build a robust predictive model. 

# Objectives 
 To clean and preprocess the real estate dataset. 
 To select relevant features for model building. 
 To apply different machine learning algorithms and evaluate their performance. 
 To identify and handle outliers in the dataset. 
 To compare the performance of various models and select the best one. 

# Methodology 
1. Data Loading: The dataset is loaded with missing values handled appropriately. 
2. Feature Selection: Irrelevant columns are dropped to retain useful features for prediction. 
3. Data Cleaning: Duplicate and null values are removed to ensure data quality. 
4. Feature Scaling: Log transformation is applied to skewed features for normalization. 
5. Outlier Removal: Outliers are capped using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. 
6. Encoding Data: Categorical features are encoded using Target Encoding. 
7. Model Building: Multiple regression models (Linear Regression, KNN) are built and 
evaluated using metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE). 
8. Cross-Validation: Cross-validation is performed to ensure model stability and 
generalizability. 

# Challenges 
 Missing Values: Various approaches were explored to handle missing values, such as 
imputation and dropping. 
 Outliers: Identifying and capping outliers was critical to ensure the model's accuracy. 
 Feature Scaling: Deciding the best method for feature scaling was challenging due to the 
skewness of the data. 
 Model Selection: Evaluating multiple models and selecting the best one based on 
performance metrics required thorough experimentation. 

# Conclusion 
The final model, built using KNN, demonstrated good predictive power with a stable performance 
across cross-validation. Future steps include exploring more advanced algorithms like XGBoost 
and incorporating additional features to further improve the model's accuracy.
